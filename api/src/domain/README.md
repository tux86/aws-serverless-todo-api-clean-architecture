# Domain Layer

This folder contains the components of the Domain Layer of the project. The Domain Layer is responsible for representing the core business concepts, rules, and logic of the application.

## Structure

The Domain Layer is organized into the following sub-folders:

- `models`: Contains the domain model classes that represent the core business entities.
- `repositories`: Contains the interface definitions for the repositories, which are responsible for managing the persistence of domain entities.
- `services`: Contains domain services, which encapsulate business logic that does not fit within a single domain entity.

## Usage

The components in the Domain Layer are responsible for:

1. Representing the core business entities and their relationships.
2. Enforcing business rules and constraints.
3. Defining the contract for data persistence through repositories.

## Best Practices

When working with the Domain Layer, follow these best practices:

1. Keep the Domain Layer decoupled from the Application and Infrastructure Layers.
2. Encapsulate business logic within domain entities and services.
3. Use repositories to abstract away data persistence concerns.
4. Follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure a rich and expressive domain model.

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to the Domain Layer, ensure that you:

1. Follow the existing project structure and organization.
2. Update this README.md file if needed.
3. Write tests for new components and functionality.
4. Adhere to the project's coding style and best practices.
