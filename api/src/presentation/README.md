# Presentation Layer

This folder contains the components of the Presentation Layer of the project. The Presentation Layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, transforming data between the Application Layer and external clients, and managing input validation and error handling.

## Structure

The Presentation Layer is organized into the following sub-folders:

- `controllers`: Contains controller classes responsible for handling specific HTTP requests and calling the corresponding use cases from the Application Layer.
- `interceptors`: Contains interceptor classes responsible for intercepting HTTP requests and responses for tasks such as logging, error handling, and validation.
- `responses`: Contains classes responsible for creating and managing HTTP responses.

## Usage

The components in the Presentation Layer are responsible for:

1. Handling HTTP requests and responses.
2. Transforming data between the Application Layer and external clients.
3. Managing input validation and error handling.

## Best Practices

When working with the Presentation Layer, follow these best practices:

1. Keep the Presentation Layer decoupled from the Application and Domain Layers.
2. Use controllers to handle specific HTTP requests and call the corresponding use cases from the Application Layer.
3. Use interceptors for tasks such as logging, error handling, and validation.
4. Ensure that presentation concerns, such as data transformation and error handling, are separated from business logic.

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to the Presentation Layer, ensure that you:

1. Follow the existing project structure and organization.
2. Update this README.md file if needed.
3. Write tests for new components and functionality.
4. Adhere to the project's coding style and best practices.
