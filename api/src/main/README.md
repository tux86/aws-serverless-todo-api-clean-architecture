# Main Directory

This folder contains the components responsible for assembling the application's various layers and managing their dependencies. It is the entry point for the application and serves as the glue between the Application, Domain, and Infrastructure Layers.

## Structure

The Main Directory is organized into the following sub-folder:

- `factories`: Contains factory classes that instantiate and wire up the components from the Application, Domain, and Infrastructure Layers.

## Usage

The components in the Main Directory are responsible for:

1. Instantiating the necessary components from the Application, Domain, and Infrastructure Layers.
2. Managing dependencies between components.
3. Serving as the entry point for the application.

## Best Practices

When working with the Main Directory, follow these best practices:

1. Use factory classes to instantiate and wire up components from the Application, Domain, and Infrastructure Layers.
2. Follow the Dependency Inversion Principle to decouple the layers and enable easier testing and maintainability.
3. Keep the main directory focused on assembling the application and managing dependencies, rather than containing business logic or infrastructure concerns.

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to the Main Directory, ensure that you:

1. Follow the existing project structure and organization.
2. Update this README.md file if needed.
3. Write tests for new components and functionality.
4. Adhere to the project's coding style and best practices.
