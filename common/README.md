# Common Directory

This folder contains shared code, resources, and utility functions that are used across different parts of the project. By placing shared resources in this folder, we can maintain a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach and avoid duplicating code.

## Structure

The Common Directory is organized into the following sub-folders:

- `src`: Contains the source code for shared utility functions, types, and other resources that are used throughout the project.

## Usage

The Common Directory is responsible for:

1. Providing shared utility functions and resources.
2. Ensuring a DRY approach to code organization.
3. Encouraging code reusability across different parts of the project.

## Best Practices

When working with the Common Directory, follow these best practices:

1. Place shared code, resources, and utility functions in the `/common/src` folder.
2. Keep the Common Directory focused on providing reusable components that can be used across the project.
3. Avoid adding project-specific or environment-specific configurations in the Common Directory.

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to the Common Directory, ensure that you:

1. Follow the existing project structure and organization.
2. Update this README.md file if needed.
3. Write tests for new components and functionality.
4. Adhere to the project's coding style and best practices.
